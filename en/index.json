We show that no particular “mode” of urban sanitation (for example “sewered sanitation” or “fecal sludge management”) can be meaningfully described as “low cost” when compared to other modes. We show that economies of scale may operate for systems that transport waste from pits and sealed tanks by road as well as for sewerage. We use a case study example to show the value of being able to compare local costs to global benchmarks and identify that operational considerations such as low connection rates may be more significant in determining overall cost liabilities for urban sanitation than technical considerations such as population density, size, and degree of centralization/decentralization.\nRead the full text at DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.3c05731.\n","date":1698969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699207966,"objectID":"844da3f778e894be1796ad39b4057c1c","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/publication/narok-cactus-paper/","publishdate":"2023-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/narok-cactus-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we report results from, and demonstrate the value of, a global database for the collection and aggregation of reliable and comparable cost data for urban sanitation systems as they are built and operated on the ground (rather than the “as planned” costs that are often reported)...","tags":["urban","sanitation","cost","costing standards","benchmarking"],"title":"Does “Low Cost” Urban Sanitation Exist?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Igarashi"],"categories":[],"content":"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a United Nations agency tasked with helping countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth and human development.\nRecent advances in technology and information management have resulted in large quantities of data being available to support improved data driven decision making across the organization. In this context, UNDP has developed a corporate data strategy to accelerate its transformation into a data-driven organisation. Geo-spatial data is included in this strategy and plays an important role in the organization. However, the large scale adoption and integration of geo-spatial data was obstructed in the past by issues related to data accessibility (silos located in various country offices), interoperability as well as sub-optimal hard and soft infrastructure or know-how. All this issues have been addressed recently, when UNDP SGD integration started developing a geospatial hub - GeoHub - to provide geospatial data visualisation and analytical tools to UNDP staff and policymakers.\nUNDP GeoHub is a repository of a wide array of data sets of the most recent time span available at your fingertips! It is a centralized ecosystem of geospatial data and services to support development policymakers. It allows users to search and visualise datasets, compute dynamic statistics and download the data. In addition, GeoHub provides a feature to share their maps with the community easily. With our repository, you can also upload to share your valuable data to share with the community! It connects geospatial knowledge and know-how across the organization to enhance evidence-based decision-making with relevant data-led insights.\nGeohub ecosystem consists of sveltekit \u0026amp; maplibre based frontend web applications and various FOSS4G software in the backend side.

Then, we also started to use collected data by offline since Feb 2019.\nWe spent the minimum budget to conduct our mapping and data sharing without customizing FOSS4G so much. This our approaches might be very useful for other users in developing countries. So we would like to share our experience and approach of FOSS4G in Rwanda.\n See the video from here\n","date":1567171647,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605315427,"objectID":"ab53beff9ebdd173717d55a06aff8d6e","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20190830_foss4g2019_rwanda/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T22:27:27+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/20190830_foss4g2019_rwanda/","section":"talk","summary":"An example of usages of FOSS4G application for Rural Water Supply management in Rwanda.","tags":["FOSS4G"],"title":"[FOSS4G2019]Case Study of Data Collection \u0026 Data Sharing for Rural Water Supply Management in Rwanda","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jin Igarashi","Ronoh Kennedy"],"categories":[],"content":"Narok Water and Sewerage Services Company (hereinafter, called NARWASSCO) supplies water at Narok town and Ololulung\u0026rsquo;a town in Kenya.

For example, mapping of all water facilities in the company, and the collected data have been used to improve operations (application of new connection, leakage management, meter reading, customer care, etc.). We can say Narok water is the first water company which started to use FOSS4G in Kenya.\nOur interesting is how water company use GIS inventory data to reduce Non-Revenue Water (NRW). NRW means physical losses(leakage) and commercial losses(meter reading error, illegal connection, etc.). We think GIS technology can contribute a lot of things for water supply services, so we would like to share our experience and get some idea from participants of FOSS4G conference.\n See the video from here\n","date":1566998662,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605315427,"objectID":"c72dad781216f2a302449df9b88905e0","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20190828_foss4g2019_kenya/","publishdate":"2019-08-28T22:24:22+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/20190828_foss4g2019_kenya/","section":"talk","summary":"A usecase how FOSS4G can contribute to manageme water supply in Kanya","tags":["FOSS4G"],"title":"[FOSS4G2019]Case Study of Non-Revenue Water Management of Narok water in Kenya","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["WaQuAC-NET"],"content":"I did a presentation about \u0026ldquo;GIS and Water Supply\u0026rdquo; as an activity of WAQUAC-NET.\nif you can read Japanese, please also look my presentation from here.\nPlease see my posts in the newsletter from here.\n","date":1563285712,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587185517,"objectID":"af48f5474f55ff5b174ded97e1d4bb8e","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/publication/waquac-vol41/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T23:01:52+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/waquac-vol41/","section":"publication","summary":"I introduced my strugglings how GIS can aoproach improving water management in case of activities in Narok water, Kenya.","tags":["WaQuAC-NET","Water","GIS","Kenya"],"title":"[WaQuAC-NET Newsletter Vol41] GIS and Water Supply","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Igarashi"],"categories":["JICA"],"content":"Period: November 2018 to November 2019\nClient: The Gevernment of Thailand\n","date":1541077876,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592482144,"objectID":"00c9312a595a6d216b59f2c1f4418661","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201811-thai_cors/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T22:11:16+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/201811-thai_cors/","section":"project","summary":"This project focused to survey the information about estalishment of CORS data centre in Thailand.","tags":["Thailand","CORS"],"title":"Survey for the Establishment of the Experimental Field for the GNSS System Development in the Kingdom of Thailand","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jin Igarashi"],"categories":["JICA"],"content":"Period: June 2018 to December 2019\nClient: Water and Sanitation Corporation Ltd, Rwanda\nConducted training workshops for data collection and sharing with FOSS4G applications, then designed \u0026amp; created GIS database and data sharing platform for rural water supply management in RWASOM project.

My assignment place is called Narok Town which is on the way to Maasai Mara National Reserve. The population is about 50,000, it is the multi- tribal town. The half of population is Maasai people, the others are mixed several tribes.\nNARWASSCO is a water services providers (WSPs) of private company in Kenya, They contract the management of water service with Rift Valley Water Services Board (RVWSB). JICA carried out a grant aid project for augmentation of Narok water supply from February 2014 to April 2016. Now NARWASSCO has new water treatment plant (North WTP, 4,000m3/day) and new distribution pipes, so situation of water is much better.\nNarok town has another old treatment plant (Central WTP). Central WTP was built by Britain in 1940s when Kenya was the British colony. Although the design capacity is 1,000 m3/day, NARWASSCO produced about 2,000 m3/day before JICA project to meet the high water demand. Of course, the quality of water was not good, and there were a lot of leakages anywhere. Non-Revenue Water Ratio was about 40- 50% in Narok.\nMy activity was to cooperate to map the distribution network by GIS, then to improve the data management by GIS data. JICA had procured Trimble GPS and ArcGIS through NRW project before, but they had never used equipment after JICA experts left. Those licenses were already lost when I came to NARWASSCO. So, my first job was to recover licenses of GPS and ArcGIS through ESRI Eastern Africa office.\nAfter that, I started to map distribution network with my workmates in fields. NARWASSCO supply water to 2 towns – Narok town (3,000 connections) and Ololulung’a town (500 connections). I spent about 6 months in each town to complete mapping. The total length of distribution and service pipe is about 300 km, it was not easy to map those network under very strong sunshine of Africa. When I was mapping, I found a lot of complicated network like spaghetti. Because every field officer has different knowledge of fields before, they sometimes installed very long service pipe from distribution pipe. For example, 15 mm’s small pipe supplied water to 20-30 connections. Those house connections had never got water since installation for several years. Then, I found a lot of illegal connections and officers’ corruptions in the fields. I thought how they can solve those situation through GIS. I thought it will be better if our officers can access to map of distribution network easily. Then, I created web-based GIS application for NARWASSCO. But they did not use my application to see map, so I created other function to link billing system from GIS. Since then they started to use my GIS application to share distribution map.\nThe other important job was the way to establish GIS firmly in NARWASSCO. There was no GIS officer when I worked. I found an attachment at town planning office of Narok county government. I knew he has good skill of GIS. I recommended managing director of NARWASSCO to employee him. Although it took bit time to employee him because his tribe is not majority, he was employed in August 2016. I rushed to teach my all knowledge and skills for 2 months, before leaving Kenya.\nExcept NARWASSCO’s job, I went to observe 14 WSPs in other towns. Especially, observation of Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company (NYEWASCO) was very exciting experience for me. NYEWASCO is the best WSP in Kenya. Their NRW is 15% on average, sometimes it was less than 10%. They set about 200 DMAs and 10 staff for NRW work. The materials and equipment for repairing were inventoried properly. When a leakage found, they can go to repair immediately even at night. After observing NYEWASCO, I thought NARWASSCO also can do the same things as NYEWASSCO because they are same Kenyan.\nI want to write about life of Kenya now. The life of Narok was quite comfortable for me. Since the elevation is about 1,900m, sunshine is very strong, but temperature is 12-28 degree, and climate is like spring all year around. Fortunately, I found very nice house which has water anytime. There are 2 supermarkets in Narok, so I could buy most of necessary items. When I went to Nairobi – capital city of Kenya, I also could buy Japanese foods. In weekend, sometimes I walked about 20 minutes to watch wild zebra baby.\nNarok’s majority tribe is Maasai people, so I learned Maasai language from my teacher. Though he is 85 years old, he is very active, and went to take care of patients as a Maasai traditional doctor. Most of my workmates are also Maasai, so sometimes I visited their home. The life of Maasai is very simple. Their main food is milk from cow. They take blood with milk for taking vitamin and iron. They normally do not eat meat nor vegetable. Maasai people live with cow.\nTheir daily life starts from taking milk. After milking, they go to savanna to take care of cows until sunset. There is no electricity and water in Maasai village. I cannot forget the beautiful stars and lightning bugs when I saw at night in their village.\nHowever, such a traditional life of Maasai might be lost after several years. Now the government of Kenya promotes to market lands so that Maasai would settle there. But, Maasai is nomadic people. Unless they can move freely, they cannot have a lot of cows and keep their traditional life. I hope my friends of Maasai can keep their traditional life style.\nMy 2 years and 6 months stay of Kenya was unbelievable experience for me. That experience taught me interesting of water jobs. Now, I am working at water and sanitation sector for developing countries as consultant. I want to make full use of my experience of Kenya for other countries.\n","date":1500126784,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587185517,"objectID":"e34b5df3e8959a176c0ca36cdf6ad84d","permalink":"https://jin-igarashi.me/en/publication/waquac-vol33/","publishdate":"2017-07-15T22:53:04+09:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/waquac-vol33/","section":"publication","summary":"I overviewed what I conducted in Narok Water while I stayed for 2 years and 6 month in Kenya.","tags":["WaQuAC-NET","Water","GIS","Kenya"],"title":"[WaQuAC-NET Newsletter Vol33 ] My Activities in Narok Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Igarashi"],"categories":["JICA","Volunteer"],"content":"Period: April 2014 to September 2016\nClient: NAROK WATER AND SEWERAGE SERVICES CO., LTD., KENYA\nWorked as a GIS specialist funded by JICA and conducted the following activities.\n Mapped the entire water distribution network (approximately 300km length of pipeline in Total) in Narok and Ololulung’a town (Trimble GPS, ArcPAD, QGIS).
