Spatial data visualization and analytics for policy making</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20240705_foss4g2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20240705_foss4g2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a United Nations agency tasked with helping countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth and human development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent advances in technology and information management have resulted in large quantities of data being available to support improved data driven decision making across the organization. In this context, UNDP has developed a corporate data strategy to accelerate its transformation into a data-driven organization. Geo-spatial data is included in this strategy and plays an important role in the organization. However, the large scale adoption and integration of geo-spatial data was obstructed in the past by issues related to data accessibility (silos located in various country offices), interoperability as well as sub-optimal hard and soft infrastructure or know-how.
All this issues have been addressed recently, when UNDP SGD integration team started developing GeoHub to provide geospatial data visualization and analytical tools to UNDP staff and policymakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UNDP GeoHub is a repository of a wide array of data sets of the most recent time span available at your fingertips! It is a centralized ecosystem of geospatial data and services to support development work. It allows non-geospatial users to upload, search and visualize datasets, compute dynamic statistics and download the data. In addition, GeoHub provides a feature to create and share their maps with the community easily. Satellite imagery, spatial-temporal model generated data, as well as regular spatial datasets, can be streamed into various analytical tools to create new insights leveraged by policymakers and regular users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Geohub ecosystem consists of sveltekit &amp;amp; maplibre based frontend web applications and various FOSS4G software on the backend side. PostgreSQL/PostGIS, titiler, pg_tileserv are deployed in Azure Kubernetes (AKS) to provide advanced visualization and analysis for users. All source code is published in GitHub repository with an open-source license.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have presented GeoHub at FOSS4G 2023 Prizren. We are going to update the latest state of GeoHub since we have developed a lot of new features and UI/UX improvements. The major changes since Kosovo are as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Introduced a landing page to direct users to each page of GeoHub&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Implemented social login (GitHub authentication and UN B2C authentication)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Data upload pipeline&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User permission management for datasets and maps&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>UI improvement for data visualization&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raster analytical features (titiler algorithms)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Static image API (generate static map image from a saved Maplibre style)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

We show that no particular “mode” of urban sanitation (for example “sewered sanitation” or “fecal sludge management”) can be meaningfully described as “low cost” when compared to other modes. We show that economies of scale may operate for systems that transport waste from pits and sealed tanks by road as well as for sewerage. We use a case study example to show the value of being able to compare local costs to global benchmarks and identify that operational considerations such as low connection rates may be more significant in determining overall cost liabilities for urban sanitation than technical considerations such as population density, size, and degree of centralization/decentralization.&lt;/p>

It has been released as v1.0.0 last December. However, there are still not many use cases of developing maplibre applications in sveltekit compared to other frameworks like react. The author is involved in developing maplibre application with sveltekit in United Nations Development Programme (geohub), and also developing sveltekit based Web-GIS applications for water asset management at Eastern African countries (watergis). Hence, several useful maplibre boilerplate and components were developed in sveltekit during those projects' work. watergis/sveltekit-maplibre-boilerplate is a template which can start developing maplibre application in sveltekit with minimuum source code. Furthermore, watergis/svelte-maplibre-components consists of various useful maplibre components to add more functionality easily to your web application (all components are documented here). For instance, this component library provides you features of exporting maps, adding legends, styling maps, sharing maps, measuring distance and integrating with Valhalla api, etc. In this talk, these maplibre boilerplate and components will be briefly introduced.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Eastern Africa, most of water utilities already have some GIS data. However, they often have some challenges to utilize and share the data within the entire organization. I was involved the projects in Kenya and Rwanda since 2014. Recently, I found a sustainable way to share GIS data through vector tiles as open data. I would like to introduce these open source tools which I developed for them.

&lt;p>GIS systems are widely used in the water supply field in the world. However, most of GIS systems have high license fees and training costs for development, maintenance, and operation, and there are not many examples of effective use in the water supply utilities in general. Mr. Igarashi , lecturer will introduce a low-cost, easy-to-build GIS system that uses open source technology called Vector Tiles. He built it in Kenya and Rwanda as a GIS system that can be accessed by all staff of water utilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Currently, the following water services providers are using my tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://narok.water-gis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Supply Map for Narok Water, KENYA&lt;/a>: since June 2020.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://rural.water-gis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Supply Map for WASAC RWSS, RWANDA&lt;/a>: since July 2020.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://nakuru.water-gis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Supply Map for Nakuru Water, KENYA&lt;/a>: since August 2020.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This tool is using direct SQL to create vectortiles from your PostGIS database. So, my tool can adopt any PostGIS database easily. If there is already PostGIS in your organizaiton, it is so fast to be able to host your vectorties. But please also contact me if you do not have PostGIS database yet. I will support your organization to develop PostGIS database and adopt it for vectortiles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[WaQuAC-NET Newsletter Vol42]Site visit reports of Tohoku disaster area &amp; Bangkhen WTP in Bangkok</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/publication/waquac-vol42/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 23:09:22 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/publication/waquac-vol42/</guid><description>&lt;p>Please see my posts in the newsletter from &lt;a href="http://www.waquac.net/english/pdf/newsletter_vol.42_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Japanese Translation for QField mobile app</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201909-qfield/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201909-qfield/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started to translate Android mobile mapping application - &lt;a href="https://qfield.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QField&lt;/a> from English to Japanese since September 2019.&lt;/p>

RWASOM mainly supports 4 model districts - Rwamagana, Kayonza, Ngoma and Kirehe at the Eastern Province in Rwanda. The project conducts developments of manual and capacity building of WASAC, Districts and Private Operators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of countries focus SDGs to achieve 100% water access by 2030. Because of that, it is very necessary to collect and analyse the GIS inventory data for water supply management, especially planning and improvement of operation and maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now WASAC has started to map all of water facilities data in rural area under support of RWASOM since July 2018. Then, we also started to use collected data by offline since Feb 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent the minimum budget to conduct our mapping and data sharing without customizing FOSS4G so much. This our approaches might be very useful for other users in developing countries. So we would like to share our experience and approach of FOSS4G in Rwanda.&lt;/p>

As of February 2019,we have 4,689 water connections and 74,314m3 of water consumption in Narok, also have 580 water connections and 5,736m3 of water consumption in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a. Total length of pipeline is 144.2km in Narok and 71.7km in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NARWASSCO, currently uses FOSS4G to do data collection and data utilization for water supply services. For example, mapping of all water facilities in the company, and the collected data have been used to improve operations (application of new connection, leakage management, meter reading, customer care, etc.). We can say Narok water is the first water company which started to use FOSS4G in Kenya.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our interesting is how water company use GIS inventory data to reduce Non-Revenue Water (NRW). NRW means physical losses(leakage) and commercial losses(meter reading error, illegal connection, etc.). We think GIS technology can contribute a lot of things for water supply services, so we would like to share our experience and get some idea from participants of FOSS4G conference.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I worked at Narok Water and Sewerage Services Company Ltd (NARWASSCO) in the Republic of Kenya from April 2014 to September 2016. My assignment place is called Narok Town which is on the way to Maasai Mara National Reserve. The population is about 50,000, it is the multi- tribal town. The half of population is Maasai people, the others are mixed several tribes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NARWASSCO is a water services providers (WSPs) of private company in Kenya, They contract the management of water service with Rift Valley Water Services Board (RVWSB). JICA carried out a grant aid project for augmentation of Narok water supply from February 2014 to April 2016. Now NARWASSCO has new water treatment plant (North WTP, 4,000m3/day) and new distribution pipes, so situation of water is much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Narok town has another old treatment plant (Central WTP). Central WTP was built by Britain in 1940s when Kenya was the British colony. Although the design capacity is 1,000 m3/day, NARWASSCO produced about 2,000 m3/day before JICA project to meet the high water demand. Of course, the quality of water was not good, and there were a lot of leakages anywhere. Non-Revenue Water Ratio was about 40- 50% in Narok.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My activity was to cooperate to map the distribution network by GIS, then to improve the data management by GIS data. JICA had procured Trimble GPS and ArcGIS through NRW project before, but they had never used equipment after JICA experts left. Those licenses were already lost when I came to NARWASSCO. So, my first job was to recover licenses of GPS and ArcGIS through ESRI Eastern Africa office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, I started to map distribution network with my workmates in fields. NARWASSCO supply water to 2 towns – Narok town (3,000 connections) and Ololulung’a town (500 connections). I spent about 6 months in each town to complete mapping. The total length of distribution and service pipe is about 300 km, it was not easy to map those network under very strong sunshine of Africa. When I was mapping, I found a lot of complicated network like spaghetti. Because every field officer has different knowledge of fields before, they sometimes installed very long service pipe from distribution pipe. For example, 15 mm’s small pipe supplied water to 20-30 connections. Those house connections had never got water since installation for several years. Then, I found a lot of illegal connections and officers’ corruptions in the fields. I thought how they can solve those situation through GIS. I thought it will be better if our officers can access to map of distribution network easily. Then, I created web-based GIS application for NARWASSCO. But they did not use my application to see map, so I created other function to link billing system from GIS. Since then they started to use my GIS application to share distribution map.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other important job was the way to establish GIS firmly in NARWASSCO. There was no GIS officer when I worked. I found an attachment at town planning office of Narok county government. I knew he has good skill of GIS. I recommended managing director of NARWASSCO to employee him. Although it took bit time to employee him because his tribe is not majority, he was employed in August 2016. I rushed to teach my all knowledge and skills for 2 months, before leaving Kenya.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except NARWASSCO’s job, I went to observe 14 WSPs in other towns. Especially, observation of Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company (NYEWASCO) was very exciting experience for me. NYEWASCO is the best WSP in Kenya. Their NRW is 15% on average, sometimes it was less than 10%. They set about 200 DMAs and 10 staff for NRW work. The materials and equipment for repairing were inventoried properly. When a leakage found, they can go to repair immediately even at night. After observing NYEWASCO, I thought NARWASSCO also can do the same things as NYEWASSCO because they are same Kenyan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to write about life of Kenya now. The life of Narok was quite comfortable for me. Since the elevation is about 1,900m, sunshine is very strong, but temperature is 12-28 degree, and climate is like spring all year around. Fortunately, I found very nice house which has water anytime. There are 2 supermarkets in Narok, so I could buy most of necessary items. When I went to Nairobi – capital city of Kenya, I also could buy Japanese foods. In weekend, sometimes I walked about 20 minutes to watch wild zebra baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Narok’s majority tribe is Maasai people, so I learned Maasai language from my teacher. Though he is 85 years old, he is very active, and went to take care of patients as a Maasai traditional doctor. Most of my workmates are also Maasai, so sometimes I visited their home. The life of Maasai is very simple. Their main food is milk from cow. They take blood with milk for taking vitamin and iron. They normally do not eat meat nor vegetable. Maasai people live with cow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their daily life starts from taking milk. After milking, they go to savanna to take care of cows until sunset. There is no electricity and water in Maasai village. I cannot forget the beautiful stars and lightning bugs when I saw at night in their village.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, such a traditional life of Maasai might be lost after several years. Now the government of Kenya promotes to market lands so that Maasai would settle there. But, Maasai is nomadic people. Unless they can move freely, they cannot have a lot of cows and keep their traditional life. I hope my friends of Maasai can keep their traditional life style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My 2 years and 6 months stay of Kenya was unbelievable experience for me. That experience taught me interesting of water jobs. Now, I am working at water and sanitation sector for developing countries as consultant. I want to make full use of my experience of Kenya for other countries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The GIS project in Narok Water, Kenya</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201404narok-water/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 08:45:17 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201404narok-water/</guid><description>&lt;p>Period: April 2014 to September 2016&lt;/p>
