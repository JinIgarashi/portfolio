Spatial data visualization and analytics for policy making</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20240705_foss4g2024/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/talk/20240705_foss4g2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a United Nations agency tasked with helping countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth and human development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent advances in technology and information management have resulted in large quantities of data being available to support improved data driven decision making across the organization. In this context, UNDP has developed a corporate data strategy to accelerate its transformation into a data-driven organization. Geo-spatial data is included in this strategy and plays an important role in the organization. However, the large scale adoption and integration of geo-spatial data was obstructed in the past by issues related to data accessibility (silos located in various country offices), interoperability as well as sub-optimal hard and soft infrastructure or know-how.
All this issues have been addressed recently, when UNDP SGD integration team started developing GeoHub to provide geospatial data visualization and analytical tools to UNDP staff and policymakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UNDP GeoHub is a repository of a wide array of data sets of the most recent time span available at your fingertips! It is a centralized ecosystem of geospatial data and services to support development work. It allows non-geospatial users to upload, search and visualize datasets, compute dynamic statistics and download the data. In addition, GeoHub provides a feature to create and share their maps with the community easily. Satellite imagery, spatial-temporal model generated data, as well as regular spatial datasets, can be streamed into various analytical tools to create new insights leveraged by policymakers and regular users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Geohub ecosystem consists of sveltekit &amp;amp; maplibre based frontend web applications and various FOSS4G software on the backend side. PostgreSQL/PostGIS, titiler, pg_tileserv are deployed in Azure Kubernetes (AKS) to provide advanced visualization and analysis for users. All source code is published in GitHub repository with an open-source license.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have presented GeoHub at FOSS4G 2023 Prizren. We are going to update the latest state of GeoHub since we have developed a lot of new features and UI/UX improvements. The major changes since Kosovo are as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Introduced a landing page to direct users to each page of GeoHub&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Implemented social login (GitHub authentication and UN B2C authentication)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Data upload pipeline&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>User permission management for datasets and maps&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>UI improvement for data visualization&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Raster analytical features (titiler algorithms)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Static image API (generate static map image from a saved Maplibre style)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

It has been released as v1.0.0 last December. However, there are still not many use cases of developing maplibre applications in sveltekit compared to other frameworks like react. The author is involved in developing maplibre application with sveltekit in United Nations Development Programme (geohub), and also developing sveltekit based Web-GIS applications for water asset management at Eastern African countries (watergis). Hence, several useful maplibre boilerplate and components were developed in sveltekit during those projects' work. watergis/sveltekit-maplibre-boilerplate is a template which can start developing maplibre application in sveltekit with minimuum source code. Furthermore, watergis/svelte-maplibre-components consists of various useful maplibre components to add more functionality easily to your web application (all components are documented here). For instance, this component library provides you features of exporting maps, adding legends, styling maps, sharing maps, measuring distance and integrating with Valhalla api, etc. In this talk, these maplibre boilerplate and components will be briefly introduced.&lt;/p>

I introduced what we developed in Rwanda and what we are doing for rural water management by using open source GIS now. Also we focused our future planning of development for next phase GIS system in WASAC, Rwanda. In webinar, we presented in Japanese language together with French interpreter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The title in French was &amp;ldquo;Etude de cas sur lâexploitation du WebSIG pour lâapprovisionnement en eau en milieu rural par lâintÃ©gration du logiciel Ã  code source ouverte au Rwanda&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Eastern Africa, most of water utilities already have some GIS data. However, they often have some challenges to utilize and share the data within the entire organization. I was involved the projects in Kenya and Rwanda since 2014. Recently, I found a sustainable way to share GIS data through vector tiles as open data. I would like to introduce these open source tools which I developed for them.
The following website is a documentation for my open source softwares.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GIS systems are widely used in the water supply field in the world. However, most of GIS systems have high license fees and training costs for development, maintenance, and operation, and there are not many examples of effective use in the water supply utilities in general. Mr. Igarashi , lecturer will introduce a low-cost, easy-to-build GIS system that uses open source technology called Vector Tiles. He built it in Kenya and Rwanda as a GIS system that can be accessed by all staff of water utilities.&lt;/p>

RWASOM mainly supports 4 model districts - Rwamagana, Kayonza, Ngoma and Kirehe at the Eastern Province in Rwanda. The project conducts developments of manual and capacity building of WASAC, Districts and Private Operators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of countries focus SDGs to achieve 100% water access by 2030. Because of that, it is very necessary to collect and analyse the GIS inventory data for water supply management, especially planning and improvement of operation and maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now WASAC has started to map all of water facilities data in rural area under support of RWASOM since July 2018. Then, we also started to use collected data by offline since Feb 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent the minimum budget to conduct our mapping and data sharing without customizing FOSS4G so much. This our approaches might be very useful for other users in developing countries. So we would like to share our experience and approach of FOSS4G in Rwanda.&lt;/p>

As of February 2019,we have 4,689 water connections and 74,314m3 of water consumption in Narok, also have 580 water connections and 5,736m3 of water consumption in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a. Total length of pipeline is 144.2km in Narok and 71.7km in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NARWASSCO, currently uses FOSS4G to do data collection and data utilization for water supply services. For example, mapping of all water facilities in the company, and the collected data have been used to improve operations (application of new connection, leakage management, meter reading, customer care, etc.). We can say Narok water is the first water company which started to use FOSS4G in Kenya.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our interesting is how water company use GIS inventory data to reduce Non-Revenue Water (NRW). NRW means physical losses(leakage) and commercial losses(meter reading error, illegal connection, etc.). We think GIS technology can contribute a lot of things for water supply services, so we would like to share our experience and get some idea from participants of FOSS4G conference.&lt;/p>
