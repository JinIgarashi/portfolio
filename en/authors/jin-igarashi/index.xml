We show that no particular “mode” of urban sanitation (for example “sewered sanitation” or “fecal sludge management”) can be meaningfully described as “low cost” when compared to other modes. We show that economies of scale may operate for systems that transport waste from pits and sealed tanks by road as well as for sewerage. We use a case study example to show the value of being able to compare local costs to global benchmarks and identify that operational considerations such as low connection rates may be more significant in determining overall cost liabilities for urban sanitation than technical considerations such as population density, size, and degree of centralization/decentralization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent advances in technology and information management have resulted in large quantities of data being available to support improved data driven decision making across the organization. In this context, UNDP has developed a corporate data strategy to accelerate its transformation into a data-driven organisation. Geo-spatial data is included in this strategy and plays an important role in the organization. However, the large scale adoption and integration of geo-spatial data was obstructed in the past by issues related to data accessibility (silos located in various country offices), interoperability as well as sub-optimal hard and soft infrastructure or know-how.
All this issues have been addressed recently, when UNDP SGD integration started developing a geospatial hub - GeoHub - to provide geospatial data visualisation and analytical tools to UNDP staff and policymakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UNDP GeoHub is a repository of a wide array of data sets of the most recent time span available at your fingertips! It is a centralized ecosystem of geospatial data and services to support development policymakers. It allows users to search and visualise datasets, compute dynamic statistics and download the data. In addition, GeoHub provides a feature to share their maps with the community easily. With our repository, you can also upload to share your valuable data to share with the community! It connects geospatial knowledge and know-how across the organization to enhance evidence-based decision-making with relevant data-led insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Geohub ecosystem consists of sveltekit &amp;amp; maplibre based frontend web applications and various FOSS4G software in the backend side. PostgreSQL/PostGIS, titiler, pg_tileserv and martin are deployed in Azure Kubernetes (AKS) to provide advanced visualisation and analysis for users. All source code is published in Github with an open-source license.&lt;/p>

It has been released as v1.0.0 last December. However, there are still not many use cases of developing maplibre applications in sveltekit compared to other frameworks like react. The author is involved in developing maplibre application with sveltekit in United Nations Development Programme (geohub), and also developing sveltekit based Web-GIS applications for water asset management at Eastern African countries (watergis). Hence, several useful maplibre boilerplate and components were developed in sveltekit during those projects' work. watergis/sveltekit-maplibre-boilerplate is a template which can start developing maplibre application in sveltekit with minimuum source code. Furthermore, watergis/svelte-maplibre-components consists of various useful maplibre components to add more functionality easily to your web application (all components are documented here). For instance, this component library provides you features of exporting maps, adding legends, styling maps, sharing maps, measuring distance and integrating with Valhalla api, etc. In this talk, these maplibre boilerplate and components will be briefly introduced.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Eastern Africa, most of water utilities already have some GIS data. However, they often have some challenges to utilize and share the data within the entire organization. I was involved the projects in Kenya and Rwanda since 2014. Recently, I found a sustainable way to share GIS data through vector tiles as open data. I would like to introduce these open source tools which I developed for them.

&lt;p>GIS systems are widely used in the water supply field in the world. However, most of GIS systems have high license fees and training costs for development, maintenance, and operation, and there are not many examples of effective use in the water supply utilities in general. Mr. Igarashi , lecturer will introduce a low-cost, easy-to-build GIS system that uses open source technology called Vector Tiles. He built it in Kenya and Rwanda as a GIS system that can be accessed by all staff of water utilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This tool is using direct SQL to create vectortiles from your PostGIS database. So, my tool can adopt any PostGIS database easily. If there is already PostGIS in your organizaiton, it is so fast to be able to host your vectorties. But please also contact me if you do not have PostGIS database yet. I will support your organization to develop PostGIS database and adopt it for vectortiles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Japanese Translation for QField mobile app</title><link>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201909-qfield/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://jin-igarashi.me/en/project/201909-qfield/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started to translate Android mobile mapping application - &lt;a href="https://qfield.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QField&lt;/a> from English to Japanese since September 2019.&lt;/p>

The project conducts developments of manual and capacity building of WASAC, Districts and Private Operators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of countries focus SDGs to achieve 100% water access by 2030. Because of that, it is very necessary to collect and analyse the GIS inventory data for water supply management, especially planning and improvement of operation and maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now WASAC has started to map all of water facilities data in rural area under support of RWASOM since July 2018. Then, we also started to use collected data by offline since Feb 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent the minimum budget to conduct our mapping and data sharing without customizing FOSS4G so much. This our approaches might be very useful for other users in developing countries. So we would like to share our experience and approach of FOSS4G in Rwanda.&lt;/p>

As of February 2019,we have 4,689 water connections and 74,314m3 of water consumption in Narok, also have 580 water connections and 5,736m3 of water consumption in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a. Total length of pipeline is 144.2km in Narok and 71.7km in Ololulung&amp;rsquo;a.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NARWASSCO, currently uses FOSS4G to do data collection and data utilization for water supply services. For example, mapping of all water facilities in the company, and the collected data have been used to improve operations (application of new connection, leakage management, meter reading, customer care, etc.). We can say Narok water is the first water company which started to use FOSS4G in Kenya.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our interesting is how water company use GIS inventory data to reduce Non-Revenue Water (NRW). NRW means physical losses(leakage) and commercial losses(meter reading error, illegal connection, etc.). We think GIS technology can contribute a lot of things for water supply services, so we would like to share our experience and get some idea from participants of FOSS4G conference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Conducted training workshops for data collection and sharing with FOSS4G applications, then designed &amp;amp; created GIS database and data sharing platform for rural water supply management in RWASOM project. Collaborated with Rwandan colleagues to complete mapping all of water supply systems in the country.
